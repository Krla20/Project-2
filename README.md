The project provides a visualization of GeoJSON real estate data utilizing Leaflet, JavaScript, Mapbox, and deployed utilizing Flask and Heroku.

Data was sourced from the Houston Association of REALTORSÂ® and downloaded as a .csv.<a href="https://www.HAR.com"> Visit HAR.</a>

Real Estate data lends itself naturally to maps and the downloaded data required transformation in Python and Jupyter Notebook to obtain a list of full addresses suitable for geocoding.  The geocoding was performed in Jupyter Notebook using Geopy and is a hour+ run. The code is commented out to allow code blocks to run in a reasonable time frame. Once geocoded the dataframe was saved as [a clean .csv file.](static/data/final_HAR_df.csv)<br> was converted to a GeoJSON file.

The opacity of the bubbles allow the user to identify multiple earthquakes that are overlapped.

The chart initially loads visualizing a street map view with earthquake events but the user has the option to select a satellite view.
The radius of the circular marker indicates its magnitude while the color indicates the depth of the earthquake origin in kilometers.
